Welcome to BooBooBanisher&copy;! ðŸŽ‰

BooBooBanisher aims to sprinkle some motivation into your coding journey by displaying uplifting messages when you're trying to compile your code, whether it compiles successfully or it fails. Then you can look as peaceful as this person ðŸ§˜.

## How It Works

You can use our program to run terminal commands, more specifically to compile your code, and then it will give you a nice message to let you know whether your command was successful or not. Afterwards you have the option of seeing the actual result of your compilation. You can also get some fun statistics, like how many times your commands executed successfully! You also have the option of running our program through a CLI, or a GUI.

## Features

- Instant Motivation: Get a boost of encouragement precisely when you need it.
- Customizable Messages: Tailor motivational messages to fit your style.
- Lightweight: Doesn't add any extra weight to your workflow.
